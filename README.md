This repo was created to allow for users to contribute focused development to portions of the addon that dont receive as much love as they could be. 

### Guides, Tutorials, etc. for this addon found below here!
If you are new to Git please do not be put off by the concept of an unfamiliar system. The use of git is quite simple and can extremely useful when working in a large group on a project like this.

The download for git bash can be found [here.](https://git-for-windows.github.io/) Make sure to fork the repository and set this one as your upstream. 

```lua
-- after downloading gitbash find a folder you are comfortable working from.
-- right click somewhere inside that folder and click "git bash here" 
-- type out the following commands to set up everything.
git clone "https://github.com/yourgithubname/tfa-sw-weapons-repository.git"
-- The above command can take a while to finish. 
-- Once finished go inside the new folder and git bash here again. 
git remote -v 
-- you should see the origin as your own personal repo. To add the live repo as your upstream do the next command.
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Servius/tfa-sw-weapons-repository.git 
-- Now you can do git pull upstream and youll get any updates that are accepted into the main repo. 

-- Once youve setup all the above you will want to be able to push your changes. Do the following:
git status
git add "*" 
git commit -m "What you did; Other thing you did" 
git push
-- Go to your own repository and click on merge requests -> create new merge request -> 
-- make sure you are aiming your own repo at the main repo 
-- Describe what you are changing and whats been done in the description and title. 
-- It will also list out your commits so don't worry about being super descriptive. 
```
